```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.res = 0  # Counter for good nodes

        def dfs(curr, max_so_far):
            if curr is None:
                return
            
            # If the current node is greater than or equal to max_so_far, it's a "good" node
            if curr.val >= max_so_far:
                self.res += 1
                max_so_far = curr.val  # Update the max value along this path
            
            # Recursively call DFS on left and right children
            dfs(curr.left, max_so_far)
            dfs(curr.right, max_so_far)
            
        # Initial call to DFS with root and its value as max_so_far
        dfs(root, root.val)
        return self.res

                
```

### Problem Statement:

Given a binary tree, a **good node** is defined as a node whose value is **greater than or equal to** all the values from the root to that node.

Return the number of **good nodes** in the binary tree.

Time Complexity: O(N)- since we go through each Node once

**2. Space complexity**

There are **two kinds of space** to consider:

*   **Auxiliary variables** (like `res` or `maxSoFar`). Thatâ€™s O(1).

*   **Recursion stack** from DFS. That depends on tree height `h`.

*   Best case (balanced tree): recursion depth = O(log N).

*   Worst case (skewed tree): recursion depth = O(N).

So the **true space complexity** is:

ðŸ‘‰ **O(h)** = O(log N) average, O(N) worst case.

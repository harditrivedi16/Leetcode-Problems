class Solution:
    def subArrayRanges(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n, answer = len(nums), 0 
        stack = []
        
        # Find the sum of all the minimum.
        #Monotonically increasing stack 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 top smallest element
        for right in range(n + 1):
            while stack and (right == n or nums[stack[-1]] >= nums[right]):
                mid = stack.pop()
                left = -1 if not stack else stack[-1]
                answer -= nums[mid] * (mid - left) * (right - mid)
            stack.append(right)

        # Find the sum of all the maximum.
        stack.clear()
        for right in range(n + 1):
            while stack and (right == n or nums[stack[-1]] <= nums[right]):
                mid = stack.pop()
                left = -1 if not stack else stack[-1]
                answer += nums[mid] * (mid - left) * (right - mid)
            stack.append(right)

### **Intuition**

From the definition of the sum of all subarray ranges:

*k\_âˆ‘\_rangek*=\_k\_âˆ‘(*maxValk\_âˆ’\_minValk*)=*k\_âˆ‘\_maxValk\_âˆ’\_k\_âˆ‘\_minValk*

> It implies that we can calculate these two partial sums separately.

Let's think of this problem differently, instead of finding each subarray and getting itsÂ `minVal`Â andÂ `maxVal`, we focus on each number. If we can find that, for each numberÂ `nums[i]`, the number of subarrays havingÂ `nums[i]`Â as itsÂ **minimum value**Â isÂ `minTime[i]`. Then the sum ofÂ `minVal`Â can be rewritten as:

*âˆ‘minValk=âˆ‘minTime\[i] â‹… nums\[i]*

For example, we have foundÂ `minTime = [1, 4, 1]`Â for the arrayÂ `[X, Y, Z]`Â by some means (which will be explained in detail soon), then the sum ofÂ `minVal`Â isÂ `1 * X + 4 * Y + 1 * Z`. We don't need to know exactly which array holds which value as the minimum, but only the number of times each number is taken as the minimum!

> Now the task becomes findingÂ minTime\[i]Â for each indexÂ i.

Notice thatÂ `minTime[i]`Â depends on:

*   The number of consecutive elementsÂ **larger than or equal to**Â `nums[i]`Â on its left side. In other words, to find the indexÂ `left`Â where the value isÂ **less than**Â `nums[i]`.

*   The number of consecutive elementsÂ **larger than or equal to**Â `nums[i]`Â on its right side. In other words, to find the indexÂ `right`Â where the value isÂ **strictly less than**Â `nums[i]`.

Now we have (i - left) positions to put the starting position of the subarray, and (right - i) positions to put the ending position of the subarray. Therefore, we have (i - left) \* (right - i) valid subarrays in total, so we can calculateÂ `minTime[i]`Â as follows:

*minTime*\[*i*]=(*right\_âˆ’\_i*)â‹…(*i\_âˆ’\_left*)

*rangei*=*minTime*\[*i*]â‹…\_nums\_\[*i*]

In the array shown below,Â `nums[3] = 4`Â hasÂ `left = 0`Â andÂ `right = 6`, thus the number of subarrays havingÂ `nums[3]`Â as the minimum isÂ `minTime[3] = (6 - 3) * (3 - 0) = 9`, meaning that there are 9 subarays havingÂ `nums[3]`Â as the minimum.

**Algorithm**

*   Initialize an empty stackÂ `stack`, get the size ofÂ `nums`Â asÂ `n`.

*   Iterate over every index fromÂ `0`Â toÂ `n`Â (inclusive). For each indexÂ `right`, if either of the following two condition is met:

    *   `index = n`

    *   `stack`Â is not empty andÂ `nums[mid] >= nums[right]`, whereÂ `mid`Â is its top value:

    go to step 3.

    Otherwise, repeat step 2.

*   Calculate the number of subarrays withÂ `nums[mid]`Â as its minimum value:

    *   PopÂ `mid`Â from stack.

    *   IfÂ `stack`Â is empty, setÂ `left = -1`, otherwise,Â `left`Â equals the top element fromÂ `stack`.

    *   IncrementÂ `answer`Â byÂ `(right - mid) * (mid - left)`.

    *   Repeat step 2.

The condition `right == n` inside the `while` loop is **very important** for both minimum and maximum calculations.

Let me explain simply:

*   `right` is moving from `0` to `n` (we intentionally go up to `n`, not `n-1`).

*   `nums` has valid indices `0` to `n-1`, so when `right == n`, itâ€™s **out of bounds**.

*   But **we still need to empty the stack** at the end because there could be elements left in the stack that didnâ€™t find their "next smaller" or "next greater" element naturally.

*   Setting `right == n` forces the remaining elements in the stack to **pop out** and complete their contribution calculations.

**In short:**

ðŸ‘‰ `right == n` is a trick to *flush the stack* at the end of the array.

### **Implementation**

### **Complexity Analysis**

LetÂ *n*Â be the size of the input arrayÂ `nums`.

*   Time complexity:Â *O*(*n*)

    *   To find the total sum ofÂ `minVal`, we only need one iteration overÂ `nums`, and each number will be added to and popped fromÂ `stack`Â once, these also apply for findingÂ `maxVal`.

    *   Therefore the overall time complexity isÂ *O*(*n*).

*   Space complexity:Â *O*(*n*)

    *   We use a (monotonic) stack to keep the increasing (decreasing) sequence, in the worst-case scenario, there may beÂ *O*(*n*)Â numbers in the stack, which takesÂ *O*(*n*)Â space.

Time Complexity: O(m^2\* n)
Space COmplexit: O(m^2\* n)

# **Time & Space Complexity Explanation**

Letâ€™s break down why this `Word Ladder` BFS solution has a time complexity of **O(mÂ² \* n)**, where:

*   `n` = number of words in `wordList`

*   `m` = length of each word (all words are the same length)

***

### ðŸ’¡ **Key Operations in the Code:**

*   **Building the adjacency list (****`nei`****)**:

    *   For each word (`n` words), generate `m` patterns by replacing one character at a time â†’ `O(m * n)`.

*   **BFS Traversal**:

    *   In the worst case, we may explore every word (`n`) from every pattern (`m` patterns per word).

    *   For each word popped from the queue, we generate `m` patterns, and for each pattern we access the list of neighbor words.

    *   Each pattern lookup is `O(1)`, but the number of neighbor words in each list could be up to `n`, so:

        *   For each of the `n` words, in the worst case, we process `m` patterns and up to `n` neighbors:

            â†’ **O(m \* n)** neighbors total per word.

So the **total** worst-case time complexity across all BFS levels is:

```plain text
mathematica
CopyEdit
O(n) words Ã— O(m) patterns per word Ã— O(n) neighbors per pattern
= O(m * n * n) = O(m * nÂ²)


```

But we **only visit each word once**, and each word has `m` patterns, so we donâ€™t reprocess. Thatâ€™s why we often simplify the upper bound to:

***

### âœ… **Final Time Complexity:** **`O(mÂ² * n)`**

Why `mÂ²`?

*   Because pattern creation and comparison is **O(m)**, and we do that inside a loop that already runs `O(m)` times per word.

SPace COmplexity Explaination

### Why it's `O(mÂ² * n)`:

*   **Neighbor map** **`nei`\*\*\*\*:**

    *   For each word (`n` total), you create `m` patterns (like `h*t`, `it`, etc.)

    *   Each pattern is a string of length `m` â†’ storing `m`length strings as keys, and storing up to `n` words as values for each pattern

    *   So, total space to store keys and values = `O(mÂ² * n)`

*   **Visited Set** **`visit`\*\*\*\*:**

    *   Can hold up to `n` words â†’ `O(n)`

*   **Queue** **`q`\*\*\*\*:**

    *   BFS queue can hold up to `n` words â†’ `O(n)`

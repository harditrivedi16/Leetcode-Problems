**Problem: Longest Repeating Character Replacement (LeetCode #424)**

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

You can perform at most **k** character replacements in the string to make the longest substring with the same character.

Return the **length of the longest substring** that can be obtained by performing at most `k` replacements.

### Example:

```plain text
pgsql
CopyEdit
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'B's with 'A's, so the longest substring is "AAAA" wi

```

*   **`most_common(1)`**: This gets the most common element in `frequencyMap`. The number `1` indicates that we only want the **top 1** most frequent character.

*   `most_common(1)` returns a list of tuples, where each tuple is `(element, count)`â€”for example, `[('A', 5)]`.

*   **`[0][1]`**: This extracts the **count** of the most common element. In the example `('A', 5)`, `[0]` gets the first tuple, and `[1]` gets the count `5`.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(26)= O(1)

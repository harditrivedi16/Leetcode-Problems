```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        intervals.sort(key = lambda i : i[0])
        
        res = 0 

        for i in range(len(intervals)): 
            if i + 1 < len(intervals) and intervals[i][1] > intervals[i+1][0]: 
                res+=1 
                intervals[i+1][1] = min(intervals[i][1],intervals[i+1][1])
        return res
```

**Java Code:**

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length == 0) return 0;

        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));

        int res = 0;
        int prevEnd = intervals[0][1];

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] < prevEnd) {
                res++; // Overlap â€” remove current
            } else {
                prevEnd = intervals[i][1]; // No overlap â€” update end
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}

```

This solution removes the minimum number of overlapping intervals by sorting them by start time and counting overlaps, adjusting the end times to preserve as many non-overlapping intervals as possible.

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals, due to sorting.
**Space Complexity**: O(1), as the algorithm modifies the intervals in place and uses a constant amount of extra space.

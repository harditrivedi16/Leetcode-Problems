```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        self.k = k
        self.minheap = []
        
        # Build the initial min-heap of size k
        for num in nums:
            heapq.heappush(self.minheap, num)
            if len(self.minheap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(self.minheap)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        # Add the new value to the heap
        heapq.heappush(self.minheap, val)
        
        # Ensure the heap size remains at most k
        if len(self.minheap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minheap)
        
        # The root of the heap is the kth largest element
        return self.minheap[0]

```

> ðŸ’¡ A note on Python class, here we use self.*var\_name* only for those variable who are gonna be shared among multiple methods inside a class, for the variables who are gonna be shared only in one method and are temporary does require self.

Time Complexity: O(nlogk)

Space Complexity: k

```python

    def racecar(self, target: int) -> int:
        queue = deque([(0, 1)])  # Start at position 0 with speed +1
        visited = set((0, 1))

                # Limit the bounds to avoid unnecessary exploration
                if 0 <= next_pos <= 2 * target and next_state not in visited:

                    visited.add(rev_state)
                    queue.append(rev_state)

Complicated BFS Traversal Problem
üîÑ At Every Node (State):
You stand at a position pos with a speed speed.

You have 2 options:

Accelerate ("A")

Move to pos + speed

Update speed to speed \* 2

Reverse ("R")

Stay at pos

Change speed to +1 if speed < 0, or -1 if speed > 0

These two transitions give us 2 new nodes (states).

üîç Then What?
For each new state, we check if pos == target

If yes ‚Üí we return the number of instructions taken so far (i.e., the depth of that node in BFS).

If no ‚Üí add the state to the queue (only if it's not visited before), and continue exploring.

Why 2 \* target is a good cap:
It allows enough space for overshooting and correcting.

Ensures we never ignore optimal paths, but avoid infinite unnecessary states.

Empirically and mathematically, no optimal sequence will ever require you to go further than 2 \* target. If it does, there's already a shorter way.

Time complexity: Ist iteration we see 2 states, next we see 4 states and then 8 and so on so target^2. but we will not reach there at all as since we are keeping visited states.

Space complexity: same as time complexity.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def detectCycle(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    slow = head
    fast = head

    # First step: detect if a cycle exists
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            break
    else:
        return None  # No cycle

    # Second step: find the start of the cycle
    slow = head
    while slow != fast:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next

    return slow  # Start of the cycle

```

### Time Complexity

*   **O(n)** â€” Full traversal in worst-case.

### ðŸ§  Space Complexity

*   **O(1)** â€” No extra memory used.

Letâ€™s say:

*   `L` = distance from `head` to the start of the cycle

*   `C` = length of the cycle

*   `x` = distance from the start of the cycle to the meeting point inside the cycle

At the point where `slow == fast`:

*   `slow` has traveled `L + x`

*   `fast` has traveled `L + x + k*C` for some `k` (since it loops around)

Since `fast` moves 2x speed:

```plain text
ruby
CopyEdit
2(L + x) = L + x + k*C
=> L + x = k*C
=> L = k*C - x


```

So, if you reset `slow` to `head` and move both `slow` and `fast` **one step at a time**, they will meet at the **start of the cycle** after `L` steps.

Thatâ€™s why the second `while slow != fast:` loop works â€” it walks both pointers the same distance to the **entry point of the loop**.

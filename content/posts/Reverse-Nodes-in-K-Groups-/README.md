```python
def reverseKGroup(head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
    # Dummy node to handle edge cases smoothly (like changing the head)
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    groupPrev = dummy

    # Internal helper to get the k-th node from a given node
    def getKthNode(curr: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        while curr and k > 1:
            curr = curr.next
            k -= 1
        return curr

    while True:
        # Get the k-th node ahead from groupPrev.next
        kth = getKthNode(groupPrev.next, k)
        if not kth:
            break  # Fewer than k nodes left, no reversal needed

        groupNext = kth.next  # Node after the current k-group
        prev = groupNext      # Previous pointer for reversal, starts beyond the group
        curr = groupPrev.next # Start of the group to reverse

        # Reverse the k nodes
        while curr != groupNext:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp

        # After reversing:
        # - groupPrev.next is now the end of the reversed group
        # - prev (which is kth) is the new start of the reversed group
        temp = groupPrev.next
        groupPrev.next = kth
        groupPrev = temp  # Move groupPrev to the end of the reversed group for next iteration

    return dummy.next
```

### Intuition:

*   You‚Äôre given a linked list, and you need to reverse nodes in groups of `k`.

*   If the remaining nodes are fewer than `k`, **don‚Äôt reverse them**.

*   To solve it:

    *   Check if there are at least `k` nodes ahead.

    *   If yes, reverse that group.

    *   Then recursively move to the next `k`group.

This uses a **recursive** or **iterative group reversal** approach.

### ‚è± Time Complexity: `O(n)`

### üß† Space Complexity: `O(1)` (fully iterative, no recursion stack)

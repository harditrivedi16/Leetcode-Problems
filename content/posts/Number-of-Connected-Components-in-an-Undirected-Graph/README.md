```python
class Solution:
    def countComponents(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        par = [i for i in range(n)]
        rank = [1] * n 

        def find(n1): 
            if n1 != par[n1]:
                par[n1] = find(par[n1])  # Full path compression
            return par[n1]
        
        def union(n1, n2): 
            p1, p2 = find(n1), find(n2)
            
            if p1 == p2: 
                return 0 
            
            if rank[p2] > rank[p1]: 
                par[p1] = p2
                rank[p2] += rank[p1]
            
            else: 
                par[p2] = p1
                rank[p1] += rank[p2]
            return 1
        
        res = n

        for n1, n2 in edges: 
            res -= union(n1,n2)
        
        return res



```

**Time Complexity:**

`O(Î±(n) * E)` â€” Î± is the inverse Ackermann function (almost constant); E = number of edges.

**Space Complexity:**

`O(n)` â€” for the parent array.

Let me know if you want to do the version with union by rank/size too.

> ðŸ’¡ Ackermann function: a function that is rapidly growning recursive function

    Inverse Ackermann function: a function that is slowly growing so it is considered as a constant. 

    Basically, 

    - To understand this, the **Ackermann function** involves repeated recursive calls with very large numbers. The inverse function (**Î±(n)**) is the number of times you need to recurse before you reach or exceed **n**, and this number increases extremely slowly.

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:

        cols = collections.defaultdict(set)
        rows = collections.defaultdict(set)
        squares = collections.defaultdict(set) # key [(r//3, c//3)]

        for r in range(9):
            for c in range(9): 
                if board[r][c] == '.': 
                    continue 
                if (board[r][c] in rows[r] or 
                   board[r][c] in cols[c] or 
                   board[r][c] in squares[(r//3,c//3)]): 
                   return False 
                cols[c].add(board[r][c])
                rows[r].add(board[r][c])
                squares[(r//3,c//3)].add(board[r][c])

        return True 

        
```

This solution checks if a given Sudoku board is valid by ensuring that no number appears more than once in any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.

```python

if (board[r][c] in rows[r] or board[r][c] in cols[c] or board[r][c] in squares[(r//3,c//3)]):
    # If the current number already exists in the row, column, or 3x3 grid, the Sudoku is invalid
    return False

```

This line explains that if the current number is already present in the corresponding row, column, or 3x3 grid, it breaks the Sudoku rule of uniqueness, so we return `False`. This is the key condition that validates the board.

**Time Complexity**: O(1), since the board size is fixed at 9x9, making the number of operations constant.
**Space Complexity**: O(1), as the space used for rows, columns, and squares is bounded by the fixed size of the board.
